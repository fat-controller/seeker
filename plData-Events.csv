These fittings protruded approximately 250mm. It was the protruding fittings that made contact with the Murphy vehicle. This adaptation has now been removed, returning the supply chain vehicle to its original state and width.

Additionally, this incident stresses the importance of ensuring we utilise a banksman whenever there is a need to reverse a vehicle, as the supply chain partner driver stated during an interview that a banksman was not utilised during this manoeuvre.

1.) Strike the modification on the supply chain partner van (completed).

",Accident,Minor / Non Lost Time Injury (1A),,1A,Control Our Work Areas,,,"On 06/06/2025, the IP returned to site to continue the remedial works on the transformers, having completed similar work the previous day. After being briefed by Murphy staff and signing onto the relevant POWRA and GLNG permit, the IP and colleague accessed Transformer 3.

The transformer pens contained multiple large trailing cables on the ground, restricting safe access to the ladder and work area. While descending the scaffold ladder after multiple trips to collect tools and equipment, the IP placed their right foot on what was believed to be the ground but was in fact a trailing cable. This caused a misstep, resulting in the IP rolling their left ankle and falling.

Assistance was immediately provided by Murphy SHES Advisor and Permit Holder. The IP was taken to the site office, and rested with their leg elevated. The IP self-reported pain at 5/10, reducing to 3/10 after rest. Although advised not to drive, the IP sated within their statement they felt fit to travel and intended to visit his local hospital for assessment.

After remaining in contact with the IP to check on his wellbeing, he provided confirmation that following an X-ray at his local hospital, there was no breakage just some bruising and it was likely a sprain. The IP returned to work on 09/06/2025 and is continuing with his normal duties. This was confirmed via email by the supply chain project manager.

Actions to prevent reoccurrence:

1.) Implement a scaffold platform to cover the exposed cables, providing safer access to the working area.

2.) Create an alert to highlight the incident and raise awareness across the wider business. Emphasise the importance of utilising mental tools such as PARA and ensuring we assess our working areas and raise safety concerns. As The hazard of trailing cables was known from the previous day’s work but not reported or mitigated before re-entering the area.

3.) Ensure a proper setting to work for supply chain management via our controlling mind/package manager, and reinforce that all disciplines must conduct a POWRA assessment for their activity. No work should commence without this in place.

-  waited for his colleague to switch off the air supply 
-Vented any excess air pressure (stored energy) remaining in the line,
-Disconnected the air impact wrench from the air line

- 	Time vs Risk - The IP attempted to take a shortcut to complete the task, and this shortcut resulted in an injury.
-	Personal Risk Perception - The IP failed to treat the task of removing the socket with the care and attention required.

The site has a tight exit which includes a camber and different gradients of road surface. While the driver has been on full right lock the wagon and trailer have exchanged heights due to a combination of these events the Hiab ramp has caught a lip on the top of the cabin on the trailer pulling the ramp back and snapping the support strap.

The member of staff gestured the other driver to go ahead but as soon as they did, the driver began excessively braking, seemingly trying to cause a rear-end collision. To avoid this, the member of staff increased the vehicle distance and continued along Crooked Mile, keeping a safe driving distance.
As the vehicles approached the roundabout leading to the town centre, the member of staff noticed that the other driver appeared to deliberately wait to see which exit the member of staff would take. When the member of staff exited towards the town centre, the other driver forced their way in front of the member of staff again. Again, the member of staff distanced themselves to  a safer driving distance, but the other driver continued the erratic driving until the member of staff passed the other driver. 
At this point, the driver accelerated up to and behind the member of staff aggressively tailgating and flashing their vehicle head lights. The driver then overtook the member of staff before suddenly slamming on their vehicle brakes, forcing the member of staff to make an evasive manoeuvre. The other driver then pulled alongside the driver’s side of the member of staff’s vehicle, the passenger of the other vehicle spat at  the member of staff whose driver’s window was open hitting them in the face and eye.

The lifting eyes were still installed on the previous lid when an operative entered the area to retrieve the lifting eyes but did so at the incorrect location where the troughs were covered with scaffold boards (to protect the HV cable)
The area the operative entered meant he would have to walk on the scaffold boards to gain access to the lifting eyes.
In doing this the scaffold board slipped, and the operative slipped into the trough landing on his feet. He then stepped out of the trough.
No injuries were sustained by the operative and they were able to continue work later that morning.
",Unsafe Condition,Control our Work Areas,Exclusion Zone,1A,Control Our Work Areas,,Medium: business impact (either internal or external) but doesn't significantly impact normal operations,"During the adjacent watermain works, the civils team had installed a scaffold board cover to protect the HV cable that was already installed. Once the watermain was installed, the area was backfilled and a Ramex was used to compact the ground. A Ramex is a plant that is used to compact the ground, and it can be controlled with a remote control. This removes hazards where operatives who are using the Ramex do not have to stand behind it in a dangerous area, the plant can be controlled from the side where the operatives are standing in a safe place. To enable all areas to be compacted the feet and Heras fencing were moved onto the scaffold board cover protecting the HV cables. 
On Monday morning when the operative went to look for the lifting eyes, he saw that the feet were located on the scaffold board cover and took the shortest route by removing the Hears fencing clips and crossing using the boards. This led to the operative standing on the scaffold board cover and landing on his feet in the trough next to the HV cables that are approx. 0.9m deep. The operative was not injured and removed himself from the trough immediately. ",1P,Level 2/3 Investigation,"Heras fencing was installed on both sides of the troughs to segregate the work areas. The fencing was correctly clipped, with warning signage displayed on the Heras fencing. The scaffold board cover was installed to protect the HV cables not as a proprietary scaffold. Weather conditions were very cold and icy the previous mornings, so it is possible the boards were icy considering it happened at 9.00am.  Before the civils team started working on the installation of the watermain, they wanted to protect the HV cables and got permission from the site team to use a scaffold board cover to protect the HV cables. Lifting eyes were required for this task as there is three holes in the trough lids that the lifting eyes are treaded into.  Once the lifting eyes are threaded in properly, lifting can commence once the slinger and the plant operator are in communication with each other. There was no lifting taking place at the time of the incident. ",,,,,True,False,True

In this process a small ball is sucked up through the end of the outlet pipe and run through the piping on the truck in order to clean the line. 
When the ball reached the hopper on the truck it caused a bit of turbulance  forcing a small amount of concrete to spray out of the hopper. One of the CPO's was walking behind the truck at this time and the concrete sprayed onto him, covering a small portion of his back and shoulder. No concrete made contact with his face or skin and there was no substantial force behind the ejected concrete. 
As the ball cycled through the hopper it periodically sprayed some concrete out of the hopper, which according to the CPO's was not an unusual occurance.

The pipe remained connected to the forks but was not fully secured against movement. 

Key Findings: 
1. Load Stability Issues: The pipe was top-heavy, making it prone to rolling during transport. The securing method was insufficient, allowing movement on the forks.
2. Handling & Transport Method: The pipe remained connected to the slings and bed of the forks, but this did not prevent rolling. No additional restraints (e.g., chocks, straps) were used to restrict movement. Tall/top-heavy pipes were not secured to the mast, increasing the risk of instability.
3. Contributing Environmental Factor: A light slope outside the ancillary building may have contributed to the rolling motion during transport.

Immediate Actions Taken
-A stand-down briefing was conducted, instructing operatives that all top-heavy sections must be secured to the mast of the forks to prevent recurrence.
-A spreader beam was in the process of being designed to assist with safer lifting & Skid platforms will be introduced to improve transport stability.

Further Preventative Actions
- Ensure the design of the spreader beam is completed and that the site team is briefed on its proper use.
- Review Slinger/Signaller requirements on the floor, including assessing the need for additional Advanced Slinger/Signaller training.",1P,,"Load Stability Concerns : The pipe was top-heavy, making it prone to rolling during transport.

Operative reporting to be fine but is going to get assessed in a clinic. ",Accident,Minor / Non Lost Time Injury (1A),,1A,Control Our Work Areas,Fell from a height,,"During painting operations on pipework skids, an operative was walking between the skids when their foot slipped on the edge, resulting in a fall from a height of approximately 300mm. The operative was taken to a clinic for assessment. Following medical evaluation, the doctor cleared the injured person (IP) to return to work, and they resumed duties that afternoon.

Key Issues Identified:
1. Restricted Space Due to Three Skids in the Room: The presence of three skids significantly reduced available workspace. A staggered approach to painting may have mitigated access issues.

2.Inadequate Working Platform and Access Arrangements: The skids themselves served as the working platform, but gaps between them created fall/trip hazards. Gaps between skids should have been filled with a proper working platform. No designated access and egress points were in place for safe movement.

3.Lack of Edge Protection: No edge protection was in place around the skids to prevent slips, trips, or falls. Proper edge protection with a controlled access point would have improved safety. 

4.Ventilation Concerns: The ventilation system in the room was not operational at the time. Potential exposure to fumes could have affected the operative’s coordination, contributing to the incident.

5. RAMS Deficiencies: The current RAMS for Coating Operations does not sufficiently address: Safe access and egress when working around skids. The use of temporary working platforms to bridge gaps. The need for edge protection around skids. Ventilation requirements and pre-task checks.

Summary: This incident highlights the need for improved work area planning, safe access arrangements, and ventilation controls. Immediate actions should focus on reducing access hazards and ensuring edge protection, while long-term measures should establish safer procedures for similar painting operations.",1P,,"The incident was likely caused by a combination of poor access, inadequate working platforms, lack of edge protection, and possibly insufficient ventilation.

Plant - 9t Combi
No injury.
Damage to shutter door only.
Driver entered the fab shop to lift and move a pipe fabrication which was to be transported to the bombing shed. 
When the Combi entered the shop , the shutter doors of the shop were not fully opened - they were around 3/4 of the way up. 
The forks of the combi were not fully extended on entry to the fab shop , and so the plant fit easily under the door. 
In order to lift the pipe fabrication (which was slung off the forks) the forks were raised higher then they had been on entry to the shop.
when exiting the shop with the load , the mast of the combi  came into contact with the draught strip on the bottom of the door. 
Driver stated he was aware the door was not fully opened when entering the shop. He stated that he didn't consider the additional height when exiting the shop with the load, which led to the top of the mast coming into contact with the shutter door. Driver also mentioned he had lights of combi on , but the general lighting in the area was not very good.
PM was on site at the time of the incident - Lift was paused , damage was assessed , and found that there were no injury's to the driver ,only the draught strip on the door and the door itself had damage. Combi was also undamaged. 
Draught strip was removed from door and placed in appropriate skip following the incident.

- The IP has potentially suffered a dislocation to his right knee that required the emergency services/ambulance to attend and transport him to the nearest hospital for further assessment and treatment. 

",Accident,RIDDOR Over 7 days (UK)/Over 3 days (IRE) Lost Time Injury (3A),,2A,,"Injured while handling, lifting or carrying",,"The investigation has uncovered that the Groundforce Used Guide isn’t sufficiently detailed on the precise method of jointing the panels together. The user guide provides technical details on panel weights, sizes and panel configurations required to achieve the available surround diameters. The user guide was available but not at the works location. The team were experienced in assembling these kinds of shutters. The section engineer confirmed the required radius and panel combination.

The operatives were assembling the shutter for an internal diameter manhole of 900mm. This required a combination of 2 x A panels and 2 x B panels. The panels are flexible 3mm steel sheets provided at a preformed radius in lengths of 1520mm (Panel A), 600mm (Panel B) and 250mm (Panel B).

The team were trying to complete the final joint in the shutter by closing a joint between an A and a B panel. They encountered significant resistance in doing so leading to excessive physical manipulation which led to the injury. It was determined during the investigation that the resistance encountered was more pronounced than if the team were completing the final joint between 2 x A Panels. The short length of the B Panel (600mm) provides less flexibility than the larger A Panel. This effect was compounded by the fact the shutter being assembled was the second smallest diameter (900mm) available for the panel types being used.
4.4.6	37 manholes constructed using panel configuration for 2.1m ID chamber or greater on the gravity section and 4 WO chambers constructed using a panel configuration for 1.5m ID chamber prior to incident. This was the first configuration of panels assembled for a 900mm ID chamber of which there are 32 No. in total.

The investigation determined that the shutter system is a proprietary system common within the industry and available through all the major suppliers. A review of the user guidance for all the suppliers demonstrated a lack of detail on the method of jointing the panels together.

Ongoing engagement with the suppliers has resulted in confirmation from MGF that the combination of panels used to complete the final joint would have an impact on the resistance encountered during assembly. Both MGF and Groundforce are proposing alterations to the shuttering system to aid with jointing. These are to be made available for trial on the project because of this incident. Both suppliers are proposing a 2 panel size combination using longer panels than the currently provided Panel B and Panel C lengths.

Immediate Cause
4.5.1	IP was using excessive force to try and push Manhole shutter together, resulting in injury being sustained, dislocation of his right knee.

Underlying Causes
4.6.1	Ground force - Supplier of the manhole shutter. Provide a guidance document that contains limited information on how to assemble the proprietary equipment. No detailed sequence of how the panels are to be assembled. Larger panels enable the operatives to apply less physical force to manipulate them into position when assembling, so are more suitable to use for final fix during assembly. This guidance is the same across all suppliers for this design of manhole shutter currently used throughout the industry.
4.6.2	The current methodology being used requires manual handling/physical interaction from operatives to assemble the manhole Shutter. It has always required a level of physical force from the operatives, this has never been challenged or reviewed to see if SSOW are adequate or if there is a more innovative way that this operation can be carried out. (speak up)
4.6.3	Manhole shutter selected for task in hand was 1800mm in height. Groundforce only supply shutter heights of 1800mm. Smaller panel heights of 900mm are available from some suppliers. These can be used when the pour heights allow and require less physical force.
4.6.4	The Manhole shutter is made of metal and is difficult to manipulate into position when assembling, this difficulty is increased significantly as the dimension size is reduced. As this was a 900mm configuration it requires more force to assemble.
4.6.5	The manhole shutter was assembled in the correct configuration for the internal diameter of the air valve chamber of 900mm. However, an agreed design change required a 1200mm cover slab to be installed which the assembled configuration would not suit. Assembly of the shutter to suit an internal diameter of 1200mm would have provided more flexibility in the panels being jointed.

Root Causes - TapRoot ®
4.7.1	Procedures (wrong) – sequence wrong
The user guide provided the correct information in the number and panel types required for assembly. The guide did not provide a sequence for how they should be assembled. If the guidance document stated to finish assembling with the larger panels, it would enable more flexibility and less force to be applied when fixing the final sections together. 
On the day of incident, the shutter was assembled by joining a B Panel to and A Panel until the final joint required a joint between an A Panel and a B Panel. This sequence required excessive force to assemble. Through a re-enactment of the task, it was highlighted that by finishing on the 2 larger panels (A+A) it was easier to push the panels together and fix in position.

4.7.2	Human-machine Interface – excessive lifting/force
Poor Physical Ergonomics when pushing against the Manhole shutter led to the injury being sustained. More user-friendly design could have prevented this incident – Manhole shutter that does not require operatives to use excessive force during the assembly stage.  Pause – Stop – Reassess the activity to avoid over exertion.
Pour heights for the manhole surrounds could allow smaller shutters to be installed as required.
Note: Populate the Incident Summary within Appendix H to include the above information.


Additional actions to be completed:
- Trial new innovative design of manhole shutter and give feedback on efficiency and if it eliminates the need for operatives to use excessive force during assembly.
- confirmation from supplier on size of panels effecting amount of physical force needed to manipulate into position whilst assembling.
- Guidance document to contain sequence for assembly for each size configuration and information stating “finish on 2 of the larger panels available” 
- Ensure use of 900mm high manhole shutters when pour heights allow. ",3P,Level 1 Investigation,Operative used excessive force whilst assembling Manhole shutter resulting in injury being sustained.   ,,3P,,,False,False,False

A follow-up site visit took place on 23/12/24 and a further broken section of trough was recovered. The team attending due to the height of the route, were  unable to make an accurate assessment of the condition of the rest of the HV trough route.

During the lift with a mobile crane, an operative lost control of the tag line, the suspended steel then rotated and hit the cable tray, in turn damaging the cable. No injuries. ",Incident,Lifting,Communication,1A,Control Our Work Areas,,,"After gathering information from the site team, there were two separate incidents involving the cable trunking. 

23/11/2024 – Gantry Crane Cable Trunking & Bracket Damage:
During lifting operations, a MEWP was overextended, striking the gantry crane’s cable trunking and damaging its brackets. 

25/11/2024 – Gantry Crane Trunking & Power Cable Damage:
In a separate lifting operation, an operative lost control of a tag line, causing a steel pipe bracing to strike the gantry crane’s cable trunking, resulting in damage to the power cables. 

The fabshop presents an environment with multiple live services and frequent lifting operations. The incidents involving the gantry crane’s cable trunking and power cable reflect these challenges, but specific factors contributed to their occurrence:

1.Different Crane and Proximity to the Cable:
The incidents involved operations near a gantry crane with live cable trunking. The proximity of the lift to the cable increased the difficulty of maintaining safe operations, particularly given the confined lifting space in the fabshop.

2. Inadequate Load Control:
A single tag line could not provide sufficient control over the load, particularly in a tight environment like the fabshop.
The absence of dual tag lines left the operative with limited ability to control the load. 

3.Complexity of Lifting Operations:
The fabshop routinely handles lifting operations, but these incidents occurred during tasks requiring more precision due to their proximity to live services with a mobile crane. A lack of clear controls/awareness/briefings for operating near live equipment increased the risk.

4. Site Conditions and Challenges:
The presence of multiple live services within a tight space, requiring extra precautions and planning.
The incidents underscore how non-routine lifting operations in a fabshop can become high-risk when conducted in close proximity to live equipment.",1P,Level 1 Investigation,"The initial findings suggest that both incidents were influenced by a combination of inadequate planning, insufficient task-specific briefings, and the challenges posed by the fabshop’s environment.",,1P,,,False,True,True

A flame from the hot works fell from overhead on to the bag resulting in the bag going on fire. Fire extinguished immediately. No injuries. ,Incident,Fire,Equipment,1A,Control Our Work Areas,,,"This incident resulted from planning and communication failures. While the exclusion zone was clear when work began, the subcontractor entered during a break and left their bag in the hazardous area. This was compounded by a lack of pre-task checks and insufficient briefing for the subcontractor on safety protocols.

No injuries occurred.


It is important to note that similar failings contributed to other incidents during these works, such as the gantry crane cable damage (Record ID 95293). Both incidents reveal gaps in risk management and proactive safety planning. In the fire incident, this was seen in the lack of pre-task checks and subcontractor briefing, while in the gantry crane cable damage incident, it was evident in insufficient planning for high-risk lifting operations near live cables and adequate measures for stabilising and controlling the load during lifting. These failings reflect a need for greater adaptability in managing site conditions and ensuring all parties are aligned with safety protocols.

Addressing these issues through improved planning, communication, and site coordination will reduce the risk of similar incidents and reinforce a culture of proactive safety.",1P,,"Immediate Cause: Sparks from overhead hot works ignited flammable materials in the subcontractor’s bag, which was left in the exclusion zone.  Underlying Causes: Lack of Briefing for the Subcontractor: The subcontractor was not briefed on the site-specific RAMS, lift plan, or exclusion zone protocols, leaving them unaware of safety requirements and the risks of leaving items in hazardous areas.  Premature Subcontractor Scheduling: The subcontractor was brought on-site earlier than needed, increasing their proximity to unrelated operations. Proper scheduling would have prevented their presence near the exclusion zone during the hot works.  Assumption of Exclusion Zone Integrity: The team assumed that the exclusion zone, which was verified as clear at the start of the task, remained clear throughout the work. This assumption led to a lack of pre-task checks after the break, during which the subcontractor introduced a flammable item into the hazardous area. The absence of a secondary inspection before resuming hot works allowed this newly introduced hazard to go unnoticed. While the initial setup was correct, the reliance on the assumption rather than verification contributed to the incident.  Subcontractor Behaviour: The subcontractor entered the exclusion zone during a break and left their bag in violation of safety protocols, reflecting a lack of awareness of the risks involved.  Root Cause The root cause of the fire incident was a failure in site management and communication processes, including premature scheduling, insufficient briefing of subcontractors, and inadequate exclusion zone management.

Works have been completed at Kilburn High road (the gas pipe has been installed, backfilled and reinstated).
We currently have works being undertaken at Oxford Rd and Greville road to connect the final piece at the valve ready for pressure testing and commissioning.
The first excavation  in Greville road had been backfilled as after discussions with our subcontractor and Cadent gas the team were unable to install the pipe in this location due to the bends it was not possible to do an insertion . This excavation was backfilled prior to digging this trench at this additional location.   

On Wednesday the 13th  of November 2024 the team were working on Grenville road.  The excavation was being extended to allow the KLT team to carryout connections.  
The Murphy team had used the vac exc to extend the excavation and were in the process of installing the temp works.  
The SCS team visited site and raised concerns in regard to how the temporary works were being installed. 
At the time the team had used the vac exc to excavate 3/4metres and were installing the walers and frames as they went along.
The SCS team observed that the temporary works being installed at the time were not per the agreed temporary work design which had been agreed at a meeting on the 01st of November.
Works were stopped and the excavation was made safe.
During investigation it was discovered that the Murphy team installing the temp works had not been made aware of the new temp works agreed design and had therefore deviated from the agreed temp works design that was agreed on the 01st of Nov.
An additional frame was required to extend to the edge of the excavation however the team did not have a frame of this size onsite and the frame that was ordered to cover both excavations had been cancelled.  

A standard solution design is in place and used for these works. This design has been submitted by Murphy and approved by SCS.
SCS are the TWC for this project and have appointed our Senior Engineer as a TWS.
Murphy have appointed our Senior Engineer as a TWC for these works.  

Due to changes with the installation of the gas main it was discussed onsite with Cadent, Murphy and SCS that the team would backfill the original excavation and excavate to the side of it so that the gas would be installed as due to the bends and the existing services in the area this was a more suitable route on Greville road.  

The temp works installation would have to be altered to suit and accommodate this excavation change.  It was discussed between the SCS TWC and the Murphy TWS what changes were required and what temp work equipment we needed to order.  This is confirmed by email.  


",,Level 1 Investigation,"Initial investigations find that there was a break down in communications between Management team (SCS & Murphy) agreeing on the temporary works and the team onsite carrying out the temporary works installation.  The information which was agreed was not shared with the team. (the engineer was off sick and was not given this updated information. The agency engineer onsite covering him has finished with the Company.  The supervisor supervising the works was covering for the resident supervisor who was off sick)  The Murphy supervisor confirmed on Friday the 08th of Nov that there was no  change to the agreed design (which was agreed on the 01st of Nov) however he cancelled the delivery of the larger frame on Monday the 11th of Nov.  The team realised prior to excavation on the 13th that the frames onsite were not big enough for the excavation however continued to excavate and install the sheets and walers.  Temporary works inspections are being completed by the site engineer on Zutec.  SCS are acting as the TWC for these works and are approving, inspecting and issuing the permit to load for the temp works.

The stairs had not been used by anyone else prior to the National Grid Construction Director and lifting chargehand as the scaffold cover above the stairs, which was used to prevent any falls or un authorised access, had been struck earlier in the week.

",Accident,Minor / Non Lost Time Injury (1A),,1A,,Exposure to heat or cold,,"Glove Spec: 

EN 388 (3244):
Abrasion resistance: 3 (Good resistance)
Cut resistance: 2 (Moderate protection)
Tear resistance: 4 (Excellent resistance)
Puncture resistance: 4 (Excellent resistance)

EN 407 (413X4X):
Resistance to flammability: 4 (Excellent protection)
Contact heat resistance: 1 (Low protection, up to 100°C for short durations)
Convective heat resistance: 3 (Good protection)
Radiant heat resistance: X (Not tested)
Resistance to small splashes of molten metal: 4 (Excellent protection)
Resistance to large splashes of molten metal: X (Not tested)

EN 12477 Type A:
Suitable for general welding tasks (higher protection but reduced dexterity)
Good heat protection for arc and heavy-duty welding tasks
These gloves provide good protection for mechanical risks and welding tasks, but are not suitable for direct contact with hot materials like a freshly welded wire.

The injured person (IP) was performing a post-welding task at 16:00 on Friday, 11/10/24, trimming the burn-back off the top of the welding wire. During this process, the welding wire was still hot from the last weld, and as the IP attempted to cut the burn-back with a snips, their hand slipped, resulting in direct contact with the hot wire. This caused the glove to be pierced, and the IP sustained an injury to the left index finger.

Factors Contributing to the Incident
Glove Suitability for the Task vs. Heat Exposure: While the EN 12477 Type A gloves worn by the IP were suitable for welding tasks, they were not suitable for direct contact with a hot wire. The gloves had only level 1 contact heat resistance under the EN 407 standard, meaning they were insufficient for handling the high temperature of the welding wire. This led to the degradation of the glove material, which was unable to protect against the heat.

Hand Misplacement or Slippage: The IP's hand slipped during the task, was due to a lapse in concentration but also may have been due to the bulkiness of the EN 12477 Type A gloves, which can reduce dexterity during precision tasks like cutting burn-back. This slip led to direct contact with the hot wire, which caused the glove to fail and the injury to occur.

Time of Day – 16:00 on a Friday: The timing of the incident, late in the afternoon on a Friday, may have contributed to worker fatigue or reduced concentration. By the end of the day or week, mental and physical fatigue can affect a worker's focus and reaction times, potentially increasing the risk of mistakes such as misplacing or slipping the hand during a task.

Summary: 

The gloves, while suitable for welding, were not designed for direct contact with the hot wire, leading to glove failure. The injury occurred when the IP's hand slipped, due to a lapse in concentration and the reduced dexterity from the gloves may have been a factor.",1P,,"The initial findings indicate that the gloves, while suitable for welding, were not designed for direct contact with the hot wire, leading to glove failure.

Murphy Plant hired it from Speedy Hire. 
At the time of the incident, Clive Maher from Testing and Inspection found difficulty starting the generator. He then contacted Jimmy Leddy (Fitter), reporting that the newly hired 100kVA generator , would not start. Upon inspection, Jimmy Leddy, noticed that the generator had been delivered without any fuel. After adding fuel, the generator still failed to start. Jimmy then used a battery pack to jump-start the generator to get it started.
Once the generator was running, Jimmy immediately observed a short duration flame coming from the back end of the unit. The generator was promptly turned off and isolated.
Following the incident, an inspection was carried out by the fitters, who concluded that the flame was likely due to a seized bearing on the armature. It was believed by the fitters that the generator had been sitting idle for a prolonged period prior to being sent to Murphy, potentially allowing dust to accumulate inside the generator. This accumulation may have contributed to the bearing failure and subsequent ignition.
There was no melting or burned cables was found during the investigation. There were no signs of extensive wear or tear on the generator, and it appeared to be in new condition upon arrival.
The generator was returned immediately to Speedy Hire for further inspection and servicing.

Murphy site engineer was notified. Rig was safely relocated to solid ground.     ,Incident,Unsafe Act,North America,1A,Operate Plant Safely,,,"The drilling (borehole) rig   got stuck and this caused rutting and damage to the Wetland/Grassland – this area was specifically to be avoided.

The drilling rig weighs approx. 7tonne, the tracks are 1.4m x 2.2m. It is the smaller of the two drilling rigs that were used on this project and was selected for this borehole based on its size.

The drilling rig directly got stuck underneath the 110kVoverhead powerlines - the site lead hand had intended to traverse under the 110kv lines momentarily but had not erected OHL signs at that point. The hazard zone was demarcated, and OHL warning signage were erected at the borehole (works) location.   This practice deviated from systems of work that had been followed on the project with regard to erecting of OHL signage.     

Causeway Geotech have agreed to carry out any reinstatement works that are required e.g. filling in of holes that could create problems for subsequent farming activities.

Murphy Site Engineer has spoken to the landowner on 24/09/2024 to apologize for the damage. The landowner was satisfied with Murphy’s response and the proposed plan to level out the track marks. There was no indication from the landowner of any desire for further compensation or escalation, which reaffirmed an amicable resolution.

Prior to the works taking place Murphy site engineer had visited the borehole location to assess the suitability of the access route. The agreed route was decided upon and the subcontractor supervisor was shown the borehole location by Murphy site engineer. Subcontractor supervisor confirmed to Murphy site engineer that he was aware of the agreed access route.

The subcontractor foreman issued a verbal instruction to the subcontractor lead hand regarding the agreed access route. This was where the breakdown in communication occurred and as a result the incorrect route was followed.    

The agreed access route was specifically selected with the project ecologist during a site visit and through the environmental screening process. 

This designated access route was also agreed with the landowner on site 

RKA"" soft ground "" states "" no driving on sift ground"". This was not adhered to .
",2P,,Non compliance with project risk assessments.  Inadequate communication between subcontractor personnel resulted in drilling rig operative taking the incorrect access route to borehole location. The access route should have been physically previewed with borehole rig operative prior to entry into field.  The landowner expressed no desire to escalate the matter further and is satisfied with the proposed remediation works - simply levelling out the tracks ,,,,,True,False,True

",Incident,Plant/Vehicle Incident,Damage to Building/Property,1A,Control Our Work Areas,Hit something fixed or stationary,,"At approx. 4.00pm the 40T excavator driver (SP) parked the excavator facing the lamp post, the banks person on site looked at the room that was available for the lorries and asked the 40T driver to move forward a bit more to make sufficient room for the lorries that would be reversing into the working area. The muck away lorries were going to be filled by the 25T excavator that was waiting for lorries to arrive further down the site. 

There was some spoil, and a dumper stored along the Heras fencing where the driver (SP) attempted to park the 40T excavator. This meant that space was restricted in the area he was attempting to park, the driver (SP) stated he was cautious when moving the plant. The HMJV banksman (ND) was guiding him so the plant could be parked, made safe which then ensured there was free access for other vehicles. 

When the driver of the excavator knew where he was parking, all operatives got out of the” Line of fire” area between the excavator and the material that was stored between the excavator and Heras fencing. (ND) made his way to a safe location to the other side of the excavator while the excavator tracked forward. The lamppost was not considered at risk during the manoeuvre. 

As the driver of the excavator (SP) attempted to move the arm of the excavator, he caught the lamp post and damaged it. (SP) said that his vision of the lamp post was restricted due to the length of the boom. The extent of the damage was marking on the post caused by the hydraulic arm at point of contact and the post was leaning due to the post being hit by boom. The post was still fixed to the concrete mounting base.

After the driver made contact with the lamp post all work was stopped, and the area was made safe after checking the extent of the damage to the base of the lamppost. The supervisor (AK) reported the incident to the General Forman (MC) immediately via radio.

The basement belongs to 67 Mortimer Street. 

",Incident,Excavations,Underground or overhead services,1A,Prevent Service Damage,,,"The Gas main was located very close to the ceiling of the basement.  
The extents of the Basements in different properties vary and this basement was extending out further into the work area than the previous one.
There was a survey in place for this area as the works involve installing a new loading bay.  
These works required Cadent Gas to attend site to disconnect this gas main from the area.  Other services were also diverted/exposed by other suppliers to enable the works for the loading bay.

The excavation was opened prior to our team undertaking these works and the team were aware of the services that were present.  

The team were tasked to remove the decommissioned main and were doing so using the 3T excavator and breaker attachment.
The team were briefed on the work activities at the morning briefing at Great Portland street.

These works were following previous works that had been carried out by Cadent Gas (decommission and install a new gas main).  Co ordination had happened with service providers and they had attended site to carry out their planned works in this area prior to MCJV completing their work.

The week previous a MCJV team had removed the kerbs from this area and the MCJV team onsite on the 05th of Sept were tasked with removing the decommissioned gas main pipework and prepare the area behind it for the loading bay works.

A Permit to dig was in place and the team had been briefed and signed onto it.

At the time of the incident the team were using a 3T excavator and breaker attachment to break up the concrete and remove the decommissioned main.
The team were breaking up the concrete and the redundant gas main as they moved along the area and clearing debris as they moved along.  
As they reached the final section of the gas main requiring removal, they were using the excavator to break the concrete supporting it they pierced the basement underneath with the breaker.  

The team were unaware at the time that they had caused damage to the basement. 
A lady from the shop at 67 Mortimer street attended site and made the team aware of the damage

All works were stopped and the MCJV Management team were notified and attended site.
Witness statements were taken and a fore cause drug and alcohol test was undertaken. 

The MCJV Management team gained access to the basement and inspected the damage.  It was confirmed from evidence found in the basement (rubble and debris) that the basement had been damaged in 2 places.  The damage in both places were caused by the same work process that was being undertaken directly above.  
The team undertaking the works were unaware that they had caused any damage to the basement.  

A temporary repair was undertaken to prevent water ingress.  
The area was made safe and cornered off until further investigations and assessment of damage has been completed.  

The owner and the WCC structures team have been made aware of the incident and we are currently waiting further communications.

EASL Ltd. were on site today to calibrate the FOS-TAC Analysis system.
In preparation for the works the Domestics section was required to be energised and the FOS-TAC Kiosk supply MCB (50Amp) to be switched on.
This was the first time the Domestics section was powered up on site since mains connection.
The Domestics section was opened and checked that all MCB supplies were in the off position.
The section door was required to be open to operate the section MCCB (100A). See attached photo WA0005. 

Fault
Once the Domestics section MCCB was energised it immediately tripped. A flash was noticed on the supply side of the section MCCB. The MCC2E Main Incomer, a 3 pole 250A MCCB also tripped out disconnecting power to the MCC.

No injuries were sustained and no EO process upstream supply interruptions were noted as a result of the fault.
The panel was made safe, and upon closer inspection there were flash marks seen on the supply side of the domestics section MCCB. See attached photo WA0004. 

There does not appear to be any visual damage to the 250 Amp Main Incomer MCCB.

Observations
Pronto were on site last Thursday to modify the Domestics section to add in the 50A SP MCB for supply to the FOS-TAC kiosk. They also upgraded the Sodium Hydroxide Heater 3P MCB from a C10 to a C16 Amp unit.


Conclusion
Upon investigation it appears that when wiring the 3P Busbar supply, two sets of 3 phase tails were connected to opposing ends of the Busbar.
The second set of tails to the RHS of the Busbar length have been connected out of order with L1 to L3, L2 to L1 & L3 to L2, causing a direct short across all 3 phases. See attached photo WA0006. 

As a result the Domestics section 3P 100A MCCB is damaged beyond repair and will have to be replaced.

No clear demarcation that the basement was present.  There was no clear evidence on the ground for the team to identify basement extents.  There was no other protection present to suggest that there was a basement present.

Root cause: 
Compliancy - The team had exposed and excavated around the services in this area previously.  at this location the team were excavating on the carriage way and had achieved a 500mm depth with the perception that there was no services present and thought the area was safe to continue breaking with the machine.  They did not think they were going to encounter a basement at this depth.

Actions to prevent reoccurrence: 
Works were stopped and witness statements taken.
Permit to dig was cancelled and the area was segregated and barriered off.  
The team were briefed the following morning on the incident and basements.
Management have agreed that going forward a more detailed basement inspection will be carried out prior to excavation works to review the extent and depth of the basement.  This has been formalised and the RAMS have been updated to include this inspection.  Work package Project Manager,  Construction Manager and Work Package Site Supervisor have agreed this going forward.  
Breaking beyond the pavement with any breaker needs to be authorised and agreed by MCJV Work Package Site Supervisor in consultation with Work package Project Manager. This has since been formalised and RAMS have been updated

-The set of chains in this incident were procured in 2014 and are rated to lift in excess of 5tons in the lift configuration used 

-The SWL of the hoist is 3200kg.

-Both operatives are CSCS trained slinger / signalers 

-The operator using the hoist has a current gantry training certificate and is experienced in the use of the hoist however he is not experienced in this specific descale project. 

-POWRA completed that morning and both operatives had been briefed   were signed onto the project specific CHSP – RKA’s   

-This lift is a repeat lift that has successfully been completed on multiple occasions however it is not completed by these two operatives previously.   

-Caustic corrosion / Embrittlement is not considered a causal factor. The lifting chains & frame are stored in the L2 A34 Murphy civil compound which is a non - process area. Onsite welding inspector has examined the chain link in question and the remainder of the chains. Chain link fatigue   is not considered a causal factor. There is no sign of elongation or stretching on any of the remaining chain links.  

Due to the direction in which the chain link split it is suspected that at some stage in the previous 05 months that the chain link became damaged possibly when someone transporting the frame with the counterbalance forklift - suspected because of where the break in the chain occurred in relation to the fork pocket.

-Due to the position of the anchor points on the lifting frame, the chains are attached to the frame with hammerlocks and kept in this position. It is possible for the chains to become caught between the forks of the forklift and the fork pocket when someone is trying to lift the frame in order to transport it – see simulated image attached It is suspected that at some stage someone hit the chain link with the fork of the FLT when attempting to pick up the load. 

-There is also a scuff mark on the right-hand fork pocket which is not on the left hand one. The chain link could also have been pinched underneath the frame if the frame was dropped to ground by FLT and the chains were left hanging loose.

-When the load was being lifted the gantry crane operator stated that there was a slight movement which is thought to have been the hoist wire rope correcting itself into its position on the hoist drum as the load was being lifted. 

-This slight movement could have created a shock load which could have caused the chains to become twisted, pulling against each other creating outward pressure/ side loading the chain link that had the suspected hairline crack therefore causing it to split.  

-It is possible there was a slight twist in the chain prior to lifting  

- The ""shock load"" / wire rope correcting itself on the hoist drum would have shortened the chain leg due to the chain link pushing sideways creating sideloading pressure on the chain link that split.  - the load would have been unevenly distributed on the 4 chains after the ""shock load"". All the weight would have been distributed onto the chain leg with the link that split.

HOISTECH Engineer stated after inspecting the chains on Friday 23/08/2024 stated "" ""It is of my opinion that the chain may have had a twist in it, this is caused by rotating the master link. If this rotates enough times it can cause the chain to bundle up in what looks like a knot. This would cause side loading on the link which would break it if enough force applied.
 
Also, it should be noted that where the chain broke, it is possible it could have gotten caught in the fork pocket at some point. This would have weakened the link. 
 
Another note to take is the potential for shock loading during the usage of this chain."" 
 
The remainder of the chain looks to be in great shape with no signs of wear, damage or corrosion which would indicate that this chain was most likely in perfect working order up until the previously mentioned scenarios could have taken place. 

It appears that the chain link that split could have been damaged during transportation in the previous five months and this damage was never reported. If there was a hairline crack it may not be visual during inspection unless the chains were thoroughly cleaned and even, then it may be possible to detect it during a visual inspection.

The frame should not have been used to lift the Brokk - an alternative lifting option has been used for the past few years. This information was not communicated to the two operatives on the morning of the lift by their supervisor.   

The four lifting points are to be removed from the frame. This frame is now to be used only for transporting the Brokk around site. 

        ",1P,,"Sideloading on chain link with hairline crack when chain leg twisted / knotted during ""shock load""    caused the chain link to split.  There was a breakdown in communication between the two operatives involved in the lift and the supervisor - the frame was not to be used to lift the Brokk.   ",,,,,False,True,True

When they got the downstream stopple excavation, a small remaining portion of green ducting from the side wall of the excavation was obstructing the camera entry point. 

One of the Flowstop personnel inserted his finger into the duct to see if it was empty. Not locating anything he then proceeded to cut the duct using a hand saw. No other checks had been completed prior to the duct being cut, such as stat drawing checks, Cat scan of the duct. There was an inspection box very close to the duct that had not been investigated by the Flowstop team.

Murphy team was notified about this via the asset owner engineer who came to site at around 15:00 pm after receiving complaints from customers regarding loss of internet service. The engineer asked for assistance in checking their inspection chamber, which was located within our CDM area, where it was confirmed that the fibre optic cable had been damaged.
The green ducting located at the downstream stopple excavation was previously diverted by Murphy approx. 6 weeks ago upon the instruction of SCS to remove it out of the way as it will cause a significant obstruction when the gas team undertake their drilling operation. This was successfully completed by the Murphy team prior to handing over the site to the gas team. 

During the drilling work operation, Greville Road site was under the gas team’s-controlled zone, Murphy had only provided traffic marshal and personnel to move the fencing out when required. 
Upon the initial report provided by KLT to Murphy, Flowstop successfully removed cable ducting which was also obstructing the installation of a 24” Sandwich Valve at the Upstream stopple excavation. Two green ducting were present, one had blue rope inside and the other had 3-4 cables inside. This operation along with the removal of the ducting at the Downstream stopple excavation was not communicated back to the Murphy team.  
",Incident,Service Strike,"Telecoms, Fibre Optic or Signalling Cables (1A)",1A,Prevent Service Damage,Service Strike,,"The site at SCS has an impeccable record for the amount of excavations completed and services exposed without strikes. All due to the safe working procedures imposed by the Murphy site team. Unfortunately this event has been caused by another sub contractor not following the same safety procedures set by Murphy. I would suggest more stringent management of the sub contractors on site are put in place to control works on site and to obtain better communication.

EW updated on 09/08 to investigation = Yes and assigned Zarah Agao.",1P,Level 1 Investigation,"Poor standard of safety procedures by the subcontractor Flowstop.  -	The gas team (KLT, Flowstop and Cadent) assumed that the green ducting was empty and safe to cut -	Flowstop personnel cut green ducting within the upstream and downstream stopple excavations without further checks completed and no SSOW.  -	There was no further checks and investigation carried out by Flowstop such as CAT and Genny, stat drawings within the area before they can safely cut the green duct. -	There was a communication breakdown between all working party working at Kilburn -	No clear instruction was made to ensure everyone on site including supply chain partner must not alter or touch exposed services within the excavation",,1P,,,False,True,True

An escort vehicle was travelling with the load. The load was marshalled out of site by Murphy personnel. As it travelled up the road a Murphy staff member noticed that a cable was trailing on the road and could see that the truck had obviously just damaged the cable but they did not directly witness the damage. They called the escort vehicle to inform them and also then began to communicate with the relevant parties. Upon investigation Murphy have noted that the load being transported was 4.6 high from road surface to top of load. Also both the pole and the affected cable were completely camouflaged  by hanging vegetation. On site investigation shows that the damaged cable disappears behind overhanging tree branches which are dropping lower than 4-5 M above ground level.

The incident occurred as the bail was being slung for lifting and settled, causing a pinching force on the operative’s arm.
Sequence of Events:
		○ The operative was in the process of slinging the ducting.
		○ The bail of ducting was on the ground and being prepared for lifting.
		○ As the operative was slinging the load, the bail settled unexpectedly.
		○ The operative's arm became pinched between the settling bail of ducting and the ground.
		○ The skid, which was still in place, did not provide sufficient clearance to prevent pinching due to its 50mm thickness.
		○ The timber support on the side of the bail was damaged from a previous lift, contributing to the excessive settling of the ducts.
		○ Injured Operative reported the incident. 
 
Contributing Factors:
		○ Improper Training: The slinger involved in the operation was not a CSCS trained slinger/signaller.
		○ Damaged Equipment: The bail of ducting had damaged timber supports from a previous lift, which allowed excessive settling of the ducts. 
		○ Inadequate Clearance: The thickness of the skid (50mm) was insufficient to prevent pinching, considering the thickness of the operative's arm. This is industry standard for the ducting to arrive bailed this way.
		○ Site Conditions: Due to the presence of redundant lamp posts, trees the forks could not be used to assist in the slinging operation. Limited storage space was also factor. 
		○ Absence of Trained Personnel: The site team’s regular slinger/signaller was on annual leave, and a replacement slinger/signaller was not brought in.
 
Immediate Actions Taken:
	• The operative received first aid on-site and was subsequently advised to go to the hospital. Operative declined treatment. (On 24/07/24 Operative has accepted the advice to have it checked. Appointment at 13:00 24/07/24. Fit to Work Cert received 14:00 24/07/24 ) 
	• The area was secured to prevent further access until a full investigation could be conducted.
	• Operations involving slinging ducting were halted.

 
Site Conditions:
	• The presence of redundant lamp posts and trees restricted the use of forks given the size of the load.
	• The work area was limited, complicating the manoeuvring and placement of the ducting bail.
	• The lack of storage space restricted the use of forks. 
 
Root Cause:
Competency: Slinging of load not assessed correctly as IP was not a CSCS trained Slinger/Signaller. 
 
Planning of Works: The absence of the regular slinger/signaller, who was on annual leave, exacerbated this issue, as no trained replacement was brought in by management.
 
The site conditions also played a role. The work area was restricted by the presence of redundant lamp posts and trees, which prevented the use of safer lifting methods such as forks. The site storage is limited and constrained manoeuvring space, further complicating the operation. Lastly, the absence of a trained slinger/signaller on-site due to annual leave highlights a gap in personnel management. The lack of a certified and experienced individual to oversee the operation led to inadequate oversight and increased the likelihood of mishandling and accidents.
 
Overall, the incident was a result of a combination of lack of a CSCS trained slinger, damaged equipment, restrictive site conditions resulting in the moving materials multiple times, and the absence of trained personnel due to personnel management. Addressing these issues through improved training, site preparation, and personnel management can help prevent similar incidents in the future.
 
Recommendations for Future Prevention:
 
Training: Ensure that all operatives involved in slinging operations are properly trained and certified as slinger signallers.
Equipment Inspection: Regularly inspect all equipment, including bails and skids, to ensure they are in good condition and free from damage.
Clearance Assessment: Assess the adequacy of skids and other supporting structures to ensure sufficient clearance to prevent pinching hazards. Place and extra skid/chog underneath the existing one and support each end of the ducting with additional skid/chog. 
Site Preparation: Store materials in a designated area which can be easily accessible to forks. Clear the work area of obstacles such as redundant lamp posts and trees where possible, to allow the use of appropriate lifting equipment.
Personnel Management: Ensure that a trained slinger/signaller is always available on-site, even when the regular personnel are on leave.
Supervision: Implement stricter supervision and oversight during slinging operations to ensure adherence to safety protocols.",2P,Level 1 Investigation,"Lack of Training:  The operative involved in the slinging operation was not a CSCS trained slinger/signaller. This lack of proper training likely contributed to the mishandling of the load and inadequate safety measures during the slinging operation. Damaged Equipment:  The timber support on the side of the bail was damaged from a previous lift. This damage caused the bail to settle excessively when slung, increasing the risk of pinching and other handling hazards. Site Conditions:  The presence of redundant lamp posts and trees in the work area restricted the use of forklifts or other equipment that could have facilitated safer handling of the ducting bail. This limitation forced the team to use potentially less safe methods. The lack of storage space further restricted the use of forks and complicated the manoeuvring and placement of the ducting bail. Absence of Trained Personnel:  The site team’s regular slinger/signaller was on annual leave, and no trained replacement was brought in. This absence led to untrained personnel performing tasks that required specific expertise. Settling of Ducting:  The bail of ducting settled unexpectedly during the slinging operation, causing the operative's arm to be pinched between the ducting and the ground. This settling was exacerbated by the damaged timber support and improper handling.",,1P,,,False,False,False

The lighting fixture came off and hit the ground. ,Incident,Plant/Vehicle Incident,Damage to Building/Property,,Operate Plant Safely,,,"The operator was assisting the formwork crew by placing shutters into the hole for constructing a chamber near the impacted lamp post. The site conditions included a steep ramp, which the excavator used to access the hole. To maintain balance while ascending the ramp, the excavator's arm needed to be fully extended. Given the proximity of the lamp posts to the ramp and road, this situation was not ideal but it is the nature of the works. This challenging access and egress contributed to the incident. The weather conditions also played a part as it was raining heavily at the time. Despite the suitability of the CAT 314 as a zero-swing machine for such works, the incident occurred because the hitch of the machine was not fully retracted, resulting in a collision with the lamp post. The GA1s and GA2s inspections were up-to-date.

The primary cause was identified as the operator's decision to slew towards the lamp post instead of towards the construction site, which would have been the correct manoeuvre. The site team has been briefed on the importance of maintaining proper people/plant segregation in a  congested site and providing assistance to excavators operating in confined areas.",1P,,"The challenging site conditions, including a steep ramp and the close proximity of the lamp posts to the ramp and road, contributed to the event.

The Rail Electrification Alliance (REAL) were undertaking High Voltage (HV) cable installation prep works at Doncaster, South Yorkshire as part of the East Coast Mainline (ECML) Power Supply Upgrade (PSU) Project. 
Part of these works required the use of an SRS Road Rail Vehicle, to which accessed at Moat Hills Level Crossing (156m 65ch ECM1) under the protection of traffic management. 
Upon completion of the works, the SRS returned to Moat Hills Level Crossing to egress the infrastructure. Upon arriving at the crossing, it is reported that the SRS passed the Til-dawns lights and egressed the infrastructure without authority from the Engineering Supervisor (ES) or Level Crossing Attendant (LXA) and subsequently without traffic management in place. 
No injuries or damages were reported as a result of the event. 
The event was reported as a Close Call via the Principal Contractors (PC) reporting system at 05:32 and subsequently escalated to the Project Duty Manager (DM) at 06:20 approx. 

“For Cause” Drug & Alcohol (D&A) screening was requested to be undertaken by the project for all roles involved but due to the delay in reporting, the SRS Operator and Plant Operation Scheme Representative had already left site.

This subsidence had the potential to impact on nearby Network Rail assets which were being monitored.

Previously reported as Unsafe Condition 84591.

In the period preceding 2:30am on Sunday 26th May, track monitoring successfully identified a potential track fault in the vicinity of a cofferdam which had been installed to facilitate gas pipeline strengthening works for Cadent. The cofferdam is located within 1.4m of the live rails, with ballast installed in this shoulder area. 
Cadent are contracted to Network Rail to conduct the works and have appointed Murphy (Energy) as Principal Contractor for cofferdam installation. The design for the cofferdam has undergone Network Rail Cat2 approval.
Upon investigation of the potential track fault, some subsidence was identified adjacent to the cofferdam, resulting in track ballast movement. Timbers supporting the ballast shoulder and track support zone (in line with the approved design) had become dislodged. No movement was identified within the sheet piles or frame.
Immediate response by Murphy (Transportation) and Murphy (Energy) personnel to rectify the situation. The event was escalated to Network Rail Fault Control and an Emergency Speed Restriction was imposed.
Plans were produced to support the ballast shoulder and track support zone, including realigning the dislodged timbers. These allowed the speed restrictions to be gradually lifted. 
Ongoing track monitoring has identified no further movement in this area since the incident.

Details entered into Dropped Object Consequence Calculator with result showing consequence as “Minor” (55.90 Joules).
Full HMJV investigation required with lead investigator appointed who will be HSW Manager Jeffrey Waghorn.
",2P,Level 1 Investigation,"On May 17, 2024, at approximately 11:15 AM, during a task involving securing an auxiliary cable, an IPS operative  inadvertently dropped a steel wire tie fastening tool from a height of approximately 13 meters and the tool landed at  the bottom of the shaft. The tool landed at the bottom of the shaft in the corner by the stairs directly under where it  dropped. There was a supervisor (PY) who was standing roughly 2-3 meters from the drop point. No injuries or  damage were sustained. Similar tasks had been completed without incident at other locations in LPT2.  The weight of the tool and distance it was dropped from was entered into industry standard “Dropped Object  Consequence Calculator” with the results showing, the potential impact/injury if it had made contact with someone  as “minor”- 55.90 Joules.  The investigation has identified various underlying and root causes of the incident.  The Root cause of the incident was found to be:  Methods and Procedures:  RAMS were not reviewed or amended for change of location of activity (working on  stairs) which meant that key information was missing.   Behaviour – Despite receiving recent toolbox talks and briefings in relation to tool tethering and working at height,  the operative involved made a decision not to tether the tool.",,1P,,,False,False,False

Information from supply chain Adverse Event Investigation: 
At approximately 16:30, while inserting the rods and split spoon sampler into the borehole after finishing a dynamic sampling run, the IP picked up a 1.5m NWY drill rod. He moved it forward, positioning it ahead of the front trestle bar before attaching the hoisting swivel. However, as he set the rod back down on the trestle bar, he pinched his finger between the rod and the rod tidy lug, causing the injury.

The cut is approximately 20mm wide. 
IP Returned to work the following morning. No stitches were required, the IPs hand has been taped and bandaged. IP is due to return to the doctors on Friday for a check up on how his hand is healing. IP carrying out normal working activities.  ",Accident,Minor / Non Lost Time Injury (1A),,1A,"Control Our Work Areas,  Protect Our Health","Injured while handling, lifting or carrying",,"23/04/2024  at approx. 11:30am  the IP cut his hand using a grinder (wire brush connection) whilst carrying out the activity of mechanical brushing and degreasing on previously welded joints. 

On the morning of the accident the IP woke at 05:00am had breakfast then headed out to work.  He arrived on site at 06:45am signed in, changed into PPE then made his way to the meeting room for his morning brief. Task given for the day was cleaning the new pipe and wrapping with tape. From 07:45am till 11:00am the IP and other team mates worked on the North section pipe, once this was complete they made their way over to the South section. 

11:00am - Once they arrived at the south section they put on their harness and entered the excavation and proceeded to set up the grinder ready for their cleaning activity.  The IP was working on the right hand side of the pipe and his work colleague was working on the left hand side of the pipe. There was only one grinder so they were rotating turns on either side. 
The IP was cleaning the joint on the lower right hand side of the pipe, due to the location he was currently lay on the floor on his right hand side positioning the grinder underneath the pipe. The IP stated that he was using both hands at all times while operating the grinder. The joint that he was grinding was uneven which resulted in the grinder hitting a big section of weld protruding out which caused the grinder to kick back.

The IP has carried out this task numerous times in the past, and previously that day. He stated that this one section was carried out no different to the rest, a slow up and down steady motion, using the same applied pressure he has always done.  It was simply the the protruding lump of weld that made the grinder jump and then kick back.  Once the grinder kicked back it caught his right hand just above the knuckle resulting in a cut roughly 20mm long.  (photo attached of the position he was lay and then how the grinder kicked back and caught his hand where it did)

The IP made the team leader aware of what had happened and he was clipped back on and made his way back up the ladder and out of the excavation, he was then taken into the office where first aid was administered. The IPs hand was bandaged up and he was advised to go to hospital to get it checked out and to see if any further treatment was required. 

IP was driven to hospital by a work colleague, initial review the doctor cleaned the cut and put a temporary plaster on his hand, the IP was then given an X-Ray. Results from the X-Ray were fine and the doctor informed him that he did not need any stitches. The IPs hand was taped and bandaged up and he was told to go home at approx. 15:30pm. IP has to return for a check up on Saturday 27th @ 09:00am for a check up to see how his hand is healing. 

The IP stated that if he had left hospital earlier he would have returned to work that day, but due to the time and working hours he headed home instead. 

The IP returned to work the following day. He has been put on storeman duties as instructed by site, so that he can keep his dressing clean. 

*IP was not wearing the correct level of protection gloves. This was identified on the day of the incident. Cute level 2 and abrasion 3. The PM was very fast acting when dealing with this finding. All work activities were paused involving hand tools on both Lavender hall farm and Meriden so that the supervisors could check the level of gloves being used.  An order was put in for the correct gloves (which have arrived on site today 25/04/24) site have also ordered Kevlar sleeves as an additional layer of protection, this can also be used for canusa wrapping activities too. A sanity check has been carried out in site stores to remove and gloves which do not meet our minimum requirement.

*Working party was not wearing HAVS watches, this was identified during witness statements. The question was asked and the IP informed us that no HAVS watches are available on site. They have been off hired and they are currently using paper timesheets.  Action has been allocated to PM to contact plant and request HAVS watches as per the policy. Site manager has made contact today and ordered these.   

*This task could have been avoided if the welding had been cleaned at the stage / area the welding was carried out., meaning the operative would not have had to get into the position he did at a low level lay on the floor with restricted movement.  A discussion with the PM to see if this is something we can look at going forward.

There is currently 3 different attachments for the jet wash, this is why the quick release is used. ME is going to get 3 guns where the hose connects at the bottom so and have the way they are connected changed so it is safer for in the future.

Currently there are no rules of who can and cannot use the jet wash. Is this something we need to implement?

No PUWER checks are completed of the jet wash. Pre use checks are completed before use and completed on the POWRA located on Syrinx.

 At approx. 08:50am the RE attended an excavated area of works to carry out a pre pour inspection. The IP approached the work area, that was secure behind a Heras fence. The ER deemed that the area was relatively safe to enter, and proceeded to remove a section of fencing to enter the site. The IP wanted to inspect the dowelled bars from a different aspect, and proceeded step across the excavation, as they did not want to step on the steel. As he crossed the excavation, he grabbed a post from the palisade fencing that was being deconstructed, and this did not provide any support, and was unable to arrest his fall.

He landed on his right wrist and felt a slight pain. The IP continued to work throughout the day as at the time he did not see it as serious and did not notify anyone from the site management team. On Wednesday morning 10th January 2024, he felt pain and realised his right wrist was swollen so he attended hospital. X- ray result from the hospital confirmed that he had sustained a fracture to his right wrist. The IP did not attend work on Wednesday 10th but notified his colleague of his absence.
