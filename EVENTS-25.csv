The same 3 men returned approximately 15 minutes later and were spotted with a kayak but then left shortly afterwards. At 8:38pm the PID on one of our subcontractor's barges (WHH) set off a motion alert, the PID in question was found in the canal and retrieved the following morning. The top of the PID which houses it's hard drive is currently still in the canal and will be retrieved once the canal settles. At 7:15am, the WHH supervisor contacted the Murphy Senior Site Manager and advised that one 0.8T tracked dumper (Cormodi C85/DUM000025) and 20 metres of cut 275kv cable were stolen from the Hiab crane barge overnight and also broke into and tampered with the barge's power pack. Murphy Group security were advised straight away. At 7:30am the project SHES advisor, senior site manager and works superintendent went down to the canal towpath to investigate and discuss with the WHH supervisor. At 7:42am, the senior site manager contacted and reported the incident to the police. All 3 Murphy staff then walked the canal to investigate further and found a building with CCTV that may have captured the perpetrators. 
At 8:42am, the senior site manager contacted a member of staff who works for Garden Studios who owns the building in question to check and request any CCTV footage that may help the police. At 8:46am, the works superintendent spoke with a manager from Safer Group who own and monitor the PIDs advising footage cannot be retrieved until the PID hard drive is recovered.",Security Incident,Plant Damage / Theft,,,Control Our Work Areas,,,,,,,,,,

While reversing down the ramp, the operation was Paused.
The driver was informed  that one of his spotters holding a tag line was standing ‘at the blind side of the excavator’.

The spotter was initially a safe distance and in the correct positioning for the lift , however ,had moved up closer to the excavator and positioned himself between two concrete pilers which were to the right of the excavator -the operative was just visible in the camera in an amber zone .  

The operative had decided to move closer to the digger partly because of the unfavourable variations in ground depth , and at the time ,the spotter had a narrow space to work in - steep slope on one side (to the right)

The adaptation was attached to the drop sides of the flatbed by scaffold fittings (bolts). 

These fittings protruded approximately 250mm. It was the protruding fittings that made contact with the Murphy vehicle. This adaptation has now been removed, returning the supply chain vehicle to its original state and width.

Additionally, this incident stresses the importance of ensuring we utilise a banksman whenever there is a need to reverse a vehicle, as the supply chain partner driver stated during an interview that a banksman was not utilised during this manoeuvre.

Actions:
1.) Strike the modification on the supply chain partner van (completed).
2.) Breif to all personnel in next weeks reset pack that all operatives must use banksman while reversing. Additionally, police this during  daily SHES walks.

",Accident,Minor / Non Lost Time Injury (1A),,1A,Control Our Work Areas,,,"On 06/06/2025, the IP returned to site to continue the remedial works on the transformers, having completed similar work the previous day. After being briefed by Murphy staff and signing onto the relevant POWRA and GLNG permit, the IP and colleague accessed Transformer 3.

The transformer pens contained multiple large trailing cables on the ground, restricting safe access to the ladder and work area. While descending the scaffold ladder after multiple trips to collect tools and equipment, the IP placed their right foot on what was believed to be the ground but was in fact a trailing cable. This caused a misstep, resulting in the IP rolling their left ankle and falling.

Assistance was immediately provided by Murphy SHES Advisor and Permit Holder. The IP was taken to the site office, and rested with their leg elevated. The IP self-reported pain at 5/10, reducing to 3/10 after rest. Although advised not to drive, the IP sated within their statement they felt fit to travel and intended to visit his local hospital for assessment.

After remaining in contact with the IP to check on his wellbeing, he provided confirmation that following an X-ray at his local hospital, there was no breakage just some bruising and it was likely a sprain. The IP returned to work on 09/06/2025 and is continuing with his normal duties. This was confirmed via email by the supply chain project manager.

Actions to prevent reoccurrence:

1.) Implement a scaffold platform to cover the exposed cables, providing safer access to the working area.

2.) Create an alert to highlight the incident and raise awareness across the wider business. Emphasise the importance of utilising mental tools such as PARA and ensuring we assess our working areas and raise safety concerns. As The hazard of trailing cables was known from the previous day’s work but not reported or mitigated before re-entering the area.

3.) Ensure a proper setting to work for supply chain management via our controlling mind/package manager, and reinforce that all disciplines must conduct a POWRA assessment for their activity. No work should commence without this in place.

In the process of completing this task of the IP incurred a slight abrasion to the soft skin on his left hand between his index and middle finger. The IP was wearing gloves at the time. All relevant personnel were notified, and the IP visited the onsite medical center. First aid was administered and the IP returned to work.  ",Accident,Minor / Non Lost Time Injury (1A),,1A,Protect Our Health,"Hit by a moving, flying or falling object",,"The IP failed to follow safe working practices. in order to safely remove the socket and therefore put himself in the "" line of fire"".

Before attempting to remove the socket, the IP should have:
-  waited for his colleague to switch off the air supply 
-Vented any excess air pressure (stored energy) remaining in the line,
-Disconnected the air impact wrench from the air line 
- Once all the above steps were completed the IP should have them proceeded to safely remove the socket. 

The IP was extremely fortunate that pin only grazed his skin - he essentially "" failed lucky"". The IP has safely completed this task on numerous occasions in the past.

The following mental tools were not followed:
- 	Time vs Risk - The IP attempted to take a shortcut to complete the task, and this shortcut resulted in an injury.
-	Personal Risk Perception - The IP failed to treat the task of removing the socket with the care and attention required. The IP failed to address the risks involved in this task and failed to follow safe work practices.  This misuse or complacency resulted in the injury.",2P,,"The IP did not wait for the air pressure in the line to be vented/ released in order to safely remove the socket.   ",,,,

The Hiab has its drag and has been loaded with 2x 20ft cabins on the bed of the Hiab and one on its trailer. 

The site has a tight exit which includes a camber and different gradients of road surface. While the driver has been on full right lock the wagon and trailer have exchanged heights due to a combination of these events the Hiab ramp has caught a lip on the top of the cabin on the trailer pulling the ramp back and snapping the support strap. This has caused the rear cabin to lift and shift slightly to the side. On normal flat ground condition the loading ramps wouldn’t have touched the cabin and are designed to carry 2x 20ft cabins and we have moved this way multiple times in the past with no issues.

However the photograph provided did not clearly confirm what was being alleged to have occurred. NR requested that JMS undertake a Level 1 investigation.

Subsequent investigation has not been able to determine the veracity of the NR allegation. The subcontractor operatives involved are adamant that they were not cutting as described and have provided photographic evidence of other cutting activities undertaken on the same shift that potentially support their version of events.

Notwithstanding this, JMS have undertaken a re-brief on safe cutting methods and correct PPE , and will take the opportunity to review the relevant TBS. JMS will also carry a review of supervision to ensure it is appropriate to teh tasks being undertaken",1P,Level 1 Investigation,,,1P,,

During routine checks this morning, it was discovered that the padlock on the rear gate of the main CDM area had been cut. A thorough inspection and inventory count were conducted, confirming that nothing was missing, damaged, or disturbed. Additionally, there were no valuable items stored at the rear of the site.

At this stage, it is unclear whether this was a one-off incident—possibly abandoned once it became evident there was nothing of value—or a reconnaissance attempt in preparation for a future break-in.

By the time the incident was reported, the operative had regained consciousness, appeared to be feeling well, and was resting in his supervisor’s van with access to water and air conditioning.

After assessing the situation, emergency services were contacted at 14:23. They requested to speak directly with the operative. Following a triage assessment, it was determined that an ambulance was not required.

The operative's local GP was then contacted for further advice and the possibility of a same-day appointment. Unfortunately, the earliest available appointment was not until next week.

As a next step, NHS 111 was called for further guidance. After conducting a triage assessment, they advised that the operative should attend an urgent care walk-in centre. Based on this advice, a team member is currently accompanying the operative to A&E for further assessment and professional medical evaluation.

Although the operative appeared well after the incident, it was reported that he had been mumbling his words while unconscious. Given this concerning symptom, all appropriate avenues were pursued to ensure his health and safety.

Attached evidence to support the above statement and the failed bracket was supported by additional fixings with the event not causing any damage to any component to the GI rig.
It was determined that this event was caused through swearing of the bracket with the immediate intervention by the team to halt the activity and request for replacement of safety cage being suitable.

The member of staff gestured the other driver to go ahead but as soon as they did, the driver began excessively braking, seemingly trying to cause a rear-end collision. To avoid this, the member of staff increased the vehicle distance and continued along Crooked Mile, keeping a safe driving distance.
As the vehicles approached the roundabout leading to the town centre, the member of staff noticed that the other driver appeared to deliberately wait to see which exit the member of staff would take. When the member of staff exited towards the town centre, the other driver forced their way in front of the member of staff again. Again, the member of staff distanced themselves to  a safer driving distance, but the other driver continued the erratic driving until the member of staff passed the other driver. 
At this point, the driver accelerated up to and behind the member of staff aggressively tailgating and flashing their vehicle head lights. The driver then overtook the member of staff before suddenly slamming on their vehicle brakes, forcing the member of staff to make an evasive manoeuvre. The other driver then pulled alongside the driver’s side of the member of staff’s vehicle, the passenger of the other vehicle spat at  the member of staff whose driver’s window was open hitting them in the face and eye.

The lifting eyes were still installed on the previous lid when an operative entered the area to retrieve the lifting eyes but did so at the incorrect location where the troughs were covered with scaffold boards (to protect the HV cable)
The area the operative entered meant he would have to walk on the scaffold boards to gain access to the lifting eyes.
In doing this the scaffold board slipped, and the operative slipped into the trough landing on his feet. He then stepped out of the trough.
No injuries were sustained by the operative and they were able to continue work later that morning.
",Unsafe Condition,Control our Work Areas,Exclusion Zone,1A,Control Our Work Areas,,Medium: business impact (either internal or external) but doesn't significantly impact normal operations,"During the adjacent watermain works, the civils team had installed a scaffold board cover to protect the HV cable that was already installed. Once the watermain was installed, the area was backfilled and a Ramex was used to compact the ground. A Ramex is a plant that is used to compact the ground, and it can be controlled with a remote control. This removes hazards where operatives who are using the Ramex do not have to stand behind it in a dangerous area, the plant can be controlled from the side where the operatives are standing in a safe place. To enable all areas to be compacted the feet and Heras fencing were moved onto the scaffold board cover protecting the HV cables. 
On Monday morning when the operative went to look for the lifting eyes, he saw that the feet were located on the scaffold board cover and took the shortest route by removing the Hears fencing clips and crossing using the boards. This led to the operative standing on the scaffold board cover and landing on his feet in the trough next to the HV cables that are approx. 0.9m deep. The operative was not injured and removed himself from the trough immediately. ",1P,Level 2/3 Investigation,"Heras fencing was installed on both sides of the troughs to segregate the work areas. The fencing was correctly clipped, with warning signage displayed on the Heras fencing. The scaffold board cover was installed to protect the HV cables not as a proprietary scaffold. Weather conditions were very cold and icy the previous mornings, so it is possible the boards were icy considering it happened at 9.00am.  Before the civils team started working on the installation of the watermain, they wanted to protect the HV cables and got permission from the site team to use a scaffold board cover to protect the HV cables. Lifting eyes were required for this task as there is three holes in the trough lids that the lifting eyes are treaded into.  Once the lifting eyes are threaded in properly, lifting can commence once the slinger and the plant operator are in communication with each other. There was no lifting taking place at the time of the incident. ",,,,

In this process a small ball is sucked up through the end of the outlet pipe and run through the piping on the truck in order to clean the line. 
When the ball reached the hopper on the truck it caused a bit of turbulance  forcing a small amount of concrete to spray out of the hopper. One of the CPO's was walking behind the truck at this time and the concrete sprayed onto him, covering a small portion of his back and shoulder. No concrete made contact with his face or skin and there was no substantial force behind the ejected concrete. 
As the ball cycled through the hopper it periodically sprayed some concrete out of the hopper, which according to the CPO's was not an unusual occurance. The two CPO's stood behind the hopper and held it down with their arms while this was occurring for a few seconds until the ball finished cycling through the pump.

The pipe remained connected to the forks but was not fully secured against movement. 

Key Findings: 
1. Load Stability Issues: The pipe was top-heavy, making it prone to rolling during transport. The securing method was insufficient, allowing movement on the forks.
2. Handling & Transport Method: The pipe remained connected to the slings and bed of the forks, but this did not prevent rolling. No additional restraints (e.g., chocks, straps) were used to restrict movement. Tall/top-heavy pipes were not secured to the mast, increasing the risk of instability.
3. Contributing Environmental Factor: A light slope outside the ancillary building may have contributed to the rolling motion during transport.

Immediate Actions Taken
-A stand-down briefing was conducted, instructing operatives that all top-heavy sections must be secured to the mast of the forks to prevent recurrence.
-A spreader beam was in the process of being designed to assist with safer lifting & Skid platforms will be introduced to improve transport stability.

Further Preventative Actions
- Ensure the design of the spreader beam is completed and that the site team is briefed on its proper use.
- Review Slinger/Signaller requirements on the floor, including assessing the need for additional Advanced Slinger/Signaller training.",1P,,"Load Stability Concerns : The pipe was top-heavy, making it prone to rolling during transport.

Operative reporting to be fine but is going to get assessed in a clinic. ",Accident,Minor / Non Lost Time Injury (1A),,1A,Control Our Work Areas,Fell from a height,,"During painting operations on pipework skids, an operative was walking between the skids when their foot slipped on the edge, resulting in a fall from a height of approximately 300mm. The operative was taken to a clinic for assessment. Following medical evaluation, the doctor cleared the injured person (IP) to return to work, and they resumed duties that afternoon.

Key Issues Identified:
1. Restricted Space Due to Three Skids in the Room: The presence of three skids significantly reduced available workspace. A staggered approach to painting may have mitigated access issues.

2.Inadequate Working Platform and Access Arrangements: The skids themselves served as the working platform, but gaps between them created fall/trip hazards. Gaps between skids should have been filled with a proper working platform. No designated access and egress points were in place for safe movement.

3.Lack of Edge Protection: No edge protection was in place around the skids to prevent slips, trips, or falls. Proper edge protection with a controlled access point would have improved safety. 

4.Ventilation Concerns: The ventilation system in the room was not operational at the time. Potential exposure to fumes could have affected the operative’s coordination, contributing to the incident.

5. RAMS Deficiencies: The current RAMS for Coating Operations does not sufficiently address: Safe access and egress when working around skids. The use of temporary working platforms to bridge gaps. The need for edge protection around skids. Ventilation requirements and pre-task checks.

Summary: This incident highlights the need for improved work area planning, safe access arrangements, and ventilation controls. Immediate actions should focus on reducing access hazards and ensuring edge protection, while long-term measures should establish safer procedures for similar painting operations.",1P,,"The incident was likely caused by a combination of poor access, inadequate working platforms, lack of edge protection, and possibly insufficient ventilation. These factors need to be addressed in the RAMS, site setup, and work planning to prevent recurrence.",,,,

•	Due to involvement of Train Operator Company.
•	Due to enquiries/investigation involving Network Rail.
•	Multiple subcontractors involved in the works - TCDI X 3 operatives, Siemens X2 operatives, A&M Services X 3 operative, 2 X for A&M Services MOS switch testing, Pod Trak MEWP operator.
•	Potential that the fault may be a maintenance fault as a train was reportedly utilized on the Loop Line on the Monday following the works at the weekend with no issues reported – This needs investigating further with Signalling CRE (unsubstantiated at present).
•	Investigation team only being appointed 04/02/2025.

Plant - 9t Combi
No injury.
Damage to shutter door only.
Driver entered the fab shop to lift and move a pipe fabrication which was to be transported to the bombing shed. 
When the Combi entered the shop , the shutter doors of the shop were not fully opened - they were around 3/4 of the way up. 
The forks of the combi were not fully extended on entry to the fab shop , and so the plant fit easily under the door. 
In order to lift the pipe fabrication (which was slung off the forks) the forks were raised higher then they had been on entry to the shop.
when exiting the shop with the load , the mast of the combi  came into contact with the draught strip on the bottom of the door. 
Driver stated he was aware the door was not fully opened when entering the shop. He stated that he didn't consider the additional height when exiting the shop with the load, which led to the top of the mast coming into contact with the shutter door. Driver also mentioned he had lights of combi on , but the general lighting in the area was not very good.
PM was on site at the time of the incident - Lift was paused , damage was assessed , and found that there were no injury's to the driver ,only the draught strip on the door and the door itself had damage. Combi was also undamaged. 
Draught strip was removed from door and placed in appropriate skip following the incident.

- The IP has potentially suffered a dislocation to his right knee that required the emergency services/ambulance to attend and transport him to the nearest hospital for further assessment and treatment. 

",Accident,RIDDOR Over 7 days (UK)/Over 3 days (IRE) Lost Time Injury (3A),,2A,N/A,"Injured while handling, lifting or carrying",,"The investigation has uncovered that the Groundforce Used Guide isn’t sufficiently detailed on the precise method of jointing the panels together. The user guide provides technical details on panel weights, sizes and panel configurations required to achieve the available surround diameters. The user guide was available but not at the works location. The team were experienced in assembling these kinds of shutters. The section engineer confirmed the required radius and panel combination.

The operatives were assembling the shutter for an internal diameter manhole of 900mm. This required a combination of 2 x A panels and 2 x B panels. The panels are flexible 3mm steel sheets provided at a preformed radius in lengths of 1520mm (Panel A), 600mm (Panel B) and 250mm (Panel B).

The team were trying to complete the final joint in the shutter by closing a joint between an A and a B panel. They encountered significant resistance in doing so leading to excessive physical manipulation which led to the injury. It was determined during the investigation that the resistance encountered was more pronounced than if the team were completing the final joint between 2 x A Panels. The short length of the B Panel (600mm) provides less flexibility than the larger A Panel. This effect was compounded by the fact the shutter being assembled was the second smallest diameter (900mm) available for the panel types being used.
4.4.6	37 manholes constructed using panel configuration for 2.1m ID chamber or greater on the gravity section and 4 WO chambers constructed using a panel configuration for 1.5m ID chamber prior to incident. This was the first configuration of panels assembled for a 900mm ID chamber of which there are 32 No. in total.

The investigation determined that the shutter system is a proprietary system common within the industry and available through all the major suppliers. A review of the user guidance for all the suppliers demonstrated a lack of detail on the method of jointing the panels together.

Ongoing engagement with the suppliers has resulted in confirmation from MGF that the combination of panels used to complete the final joint would have an impact on the resistance encountered during assembly. Both MGF and Groundforce are proposing alterations to the shuttering system to aid with jointing. These are to be made available for trial on the project because of this incident. Both suppliers are proposing a 2 panel size combination using longer panels than the currently provided Panel B and Panel C lengths.

Immediate Cause
4.5.1	IP was using excessive force to try and push Manhole shutter together, resulting in injury being sustained, dislocation of his right knee.

Underlying Causes
4.6.1	Ground force - Supplier of the manhole shutter. Provide a guidance document that contains limited information on how to assemble the proprietary equipment. No detailed sequence of how the panels are to be assembled. Larger panels enable the operatives to apply less physical force to manipulate them into position when assembling, so are more suitable to use for final fix during assembly. This guidance is the same across all suppliers for this design of manhole shutter currently used throughout the industry.
4.6.2	The current methodology being used requires manual handling/physical interaction from operatives to assemble the manhole Shutter. It has always required a level of physical force from the operatives, this has never been challenged or reviewed to see if SSOW are adequate or if there is a more innovative way that this operation can be carried out.

4.6.3	Manhole shutter selected for task in hand was 1800mm in height. Groundforce only supply shutter heights of 1800mm. Smaller panel heights of 900mm are available from some suppliers. These can be used when the pour heights allow and require less physical force.
4.6.4	The Manhole shutter is made of metal and is difficult to manipulate into position when assembling, this difficulty is increased significantly as the dimension size is reduced. As this was a 900mm configuration it requires more force to assemble.
4.6.5	The manhole shutter was assembled in the correct configuration for the internal diameter of the air valve chamber of 900mm. However, an agreed design change required a 1200mm cover slab to be installed which the assembled configuration would not suit. Assembly of the shutter to suit an internal diameter of 1200mm would have provided more flexibility in the panels being jointed.

Root Causes - TapRoot ®
4.7.1	Procedures (wrong) – sequence wrong
The user guide provided the correct information in the number and panel types required for assembly. The guide did not provide a sequence for how they should be assembled. If the guidance document stated to finish assembling with the larger panels, it would enable more flexibility and less force to be applied when fixing the final sections together. 
On the day of incident, the shutter was assembled by joining a B Panel to and A Panel until the final joint required a joint between an A Panel and a B Panel. This sequence required excessive force to assemble. Through a re-enactment of the task, it was highlighted that by finishing on the 2 larger panels (A+A) it was easier to push the panels together and fix in position.

4.7.2	Human-machine Interface – excessive lifting/force
Poor Physical Ergonomics when pushing against the Manhole shutter led to the injury being sustained. More user-friendly design could have prevented this incident – Manhole shutter that does not require operatives to use excessive force during the assembly stage.  Pause – Stop – Reassess the activity to avoid over exertion.
Pour heights for the manhole surrounds could allow smaller shutters to be installed as required.
Note: Populate the Incident Summary within Appendix H to include the above information.


Additional actions to be completed:
- Trial new innovative design of manhole shutter and give feedback on efficiency and if it eliminates the need for operatives to use excessive force during assembly.
- confirmation from supplier on size of panels effecting amount of physical force needed to manipulate into position whilst assembling.
- Guidance document to contain sequence for assembly for each size configuration and information stating “finish on 2 of the larger panels available” 
- Ensure use of 900mm high manhole shutters when pour heights allow. ",3P,Level 1 Investigation,"Operative used excessive force whilst assembling Manhole shutter resulting in injury being sustained.   ",,3P,,
